# studyingShowTime

## Description

That's part of our student work as students of edX - Skills for Life. It's the project1, which is mandatory collaborative work with 3-4 students in total. We need to conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.

## Overview

A team of student Front-End Engineers, CANS, had a brainstorming session on 22nd November which led to the idea of developing a new product. During that session we identified some problems, which made it ideal to further examine the chance to create a solution for those problems. 

Film students wants to access a website, which contains live-streaming of movies, films, series. Also, it is expected to have more than usual basic information compared to live-streaming providers. On the top of it they are willing to use advanced search keywords, sorting, filtering and segmenting data. Lastly relevant view to be created either by default or after playing with the data.

## Problem: 

live streaming providers having limited options to filter, sort, search. Also, some views’ answers are limited to one live-streaming company. For instance top10 series/movies per country & etc from one data source. The above problem led us to identifying the opportunity for the market. So, we decided to collaborate with university film studies students who use all live-streaming providers extensively and many other websites where they can obtain film, movies, series and other relevant information.

We conducted on 23rd November a market research to validate that gap in the market by researching top companies like Netflix, Amazon Video, Apple TV, etc. We analysed the competitors and we found grounds to believe our solution will solve the problem(s) of our niche audience of film students.

All the above led us on drafting the MVP, minimum viable product.

### User Story: 

Users want to check on mobile phones one service provider (website) and obtain all the knowledge they are looking for. Also, they would like to be able to watch what they are looking for by searching with advanced criteria.

There are two layers of search - value proposition:
1) Informative aggregated data such as year of production, released date and further details, which cannot be found all together in one website.
2) Find a trailer and be able to choose on where to watch the movie/series (cost efficient)
The above two are the two main goals we are looking forward to achieving.

### Acceptance Criteria: 

1) A responsive and functional website (mobile and desktop version).
2) Search a movie, film, series based on year of production, release date.
3) Select movie, film, series based on the main actor.
4) Home page should display an appealing layout with current, new and different genres.
5) Movies should be listed with year released, actors’ name and brief movie description.
6) Users should be able to click on a movie to view more details of the movie.
7) Users should be able to search for movies using keywords such as titles and released/production dates.

### General mandatory requirements:

- [] Use Bootstrap
- [] Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- [] Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- [] Use at least two [server-side APIs]
- [x] Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- [] Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- [x] Be responsive.
- [] Have a polished UI.
- [x] Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- [x] Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

From time to time we learnt coding, asked questions about coding and we 've told ways to deal with aspects of this project and not only from edX's - 2U employees:
* Omar Patel (Teacher Engineer)
* Riz (TA)
* Juno (TA)
* Ryan S (TA)
* Phil Loy (Tutor)
