# studyingShowTime

## Description

That's part of our student work as students of edX - Skills for Life. It's the project1, which is mandatory collaborative work with 3-4 students in total. We need to conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.

### User Story: 
A group of film students came in contact with front-end students. They want to receive a help by front-end students so they can have a brand new website, where they can retrieve relevant information to their needs. [It will be added more content here by Niko]

### Acceptance Criteria: 

[It will be updated by Chiamaka]
[These are the requirements that you must meet to satisfy the scope of work. They are not exhaustive, but they do entail the minimum aspects of a working solution. Consider this a checklist of baseline requirements. Acceptance criteria can be presented in various ways. In this case, we'll use a common format called scenario-oriented criteria which expresses each requirement in a WHEN / THEN format. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense now; it will become very familiar to you after you complete a couple of challenges.]

### Mock-up: 
[It will be updated by Chiamaka with Figma and screenshots from there]
[This is an image or animation that demonstrates the design and functionality of the web application that you'll build for the Challenge.]

From time to time we learnt coding, asked questions about coding and we 've told ways to deal with aspects of this project and not only from edX's - 2U employees:
Omar Patel (Teacher Engineer)
Riz (TA)
Juno (TA)
Ryan (TA)

As a student of edX - Skills for life - skills bootcamps here: https://skillsforlife.edx.org and precisely Front-End developer / Web Development course I reference any code you might see as a copy or partially copy or influenced by the repo here: https://git.bootcampcontent.com/uk-edx-16-week/UK-VIRT-FE-PT-09-2023-U-LOLC.git
